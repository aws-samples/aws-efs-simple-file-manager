Simple File Manager for Amazon EFS provides access to Amazon EFS through a RESTful API and responsive web app. Working together, these components enable the ability to manage data in an EFS filesystem from any location or device that can access the internet. A user can simply log-in to the Simple File Manager application from a web browser and directly upload, view, delete, or download their data in any Amazon EFS filesystem in their AWS account without needing to setup or maintain any dedicated EC2 or networking infrastructure.

You can deploy the open source solution by clicking a one-click deployment link in the install section below.

***Note: This project is in an early beta stage. Please report bugs if you find them.***

# Install

Region| Launch
------|-----
US East (N. Virginia) | [![Launch in us-east-1](docs/assets/images/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=sfm&templateURL=https://rodeolabz-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/)
US West (Oregon) | [![Launch in us-west-2](docs/assets/images/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=sfm&templateURL=https://rodeolabz-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/)


# Getting Started

1. Launch the solution by clicking a one click link for the desired region.
    * *Make sure to review the [installation parameters](#installation-parameters) section.*
2. Follow the stack creation prompts in CloudFormation.
3. When the deployment is completed, you will find the URL to the application in the "Outputs" tab of the stack.
4. Navigate to the application URL in a web browser.

*During stack creation, you will have received an email containing your initial login credentials.*

5. Use the inital credentials to sign in. You will be required to create a new password. 
6. Upon successful authentication, the application will route you to the home page, where you will see all the EFS Filesystems in your account.
7. To grant Simple File Manager access to a file system, click the link labeled "false". This will take you to the file manager lmabda creation page.
8. From the dropdown, select a mount target to connect the file manager lambda to. You can reference the network information for more details.
9. Click submit and wait for the application to complete the request.
10. After completion, you will be routed back to the home page.

*Currently there is a known issue where the link will initially still return "false". This is due to the fact lambda can take several minutes to replicate status across regions. Please allow 1-2 minutes if it still returns "false" and refresh the page.*

11. The link previously labeled false now returns true and the file system id is now a clickable link.
12. Click on the file system link to access the file system. 

The application will route you to the file system page, where you can now perform file system operations. The current supported operations are: *List*, *Make directory*, *Upload*, *Download*, and *Delete.*

# Cost

The cost to deploy and use the solution is minimal due to its serverless architecture, which means users pay a small fee per request, rather than an always-on fee. In most cases the cost will fall entirely within the AWS Free Tier.

# Installation Parameters

## Required parameters

**Stack Name**: The name of the stack.

**Admin Email**: The email address that will be used by the application Admin. The inital credentials will be sent to this address.
