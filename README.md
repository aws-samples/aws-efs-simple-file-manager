Simple File Manager for Amazon EFS provides access to Amazon EFS through a RESTful API and responsive web app. Working together, these components enable the ability to manage data in an EFS filesystem from any location or device that can access the internet. A user can simply log-in to the Simple File Manager application from a web browser and directly upload, view, delete, or download their data in any Amazon EFS filesystem in their AWS account without needing to setup or maintain any dedicated EC2 or networking infrastructure.
